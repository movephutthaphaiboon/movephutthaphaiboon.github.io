Recently, I had the privilege of acting as a moderator and instructor for a workshop titled “Participatory Mapping & Community Database Design”. The workshop was hosted by my team, Around the Room Studio, at Prince of Songkhla University - Pattani Campus. Participants represented five different communes from the provinces in southern Thailand, including Songkhla, Pattani, and Yala. The interests of the participants were varied and deeply connected to their local communities. These included a passion for protecting natural resources, a determination to protest against coming industrial districts that threaten their homes and environment, an eagerness for youth development and education, and a shared goal of community empowerment.

This was my maiden venture into hosting a discussion forum. Even though we held it in a private setting and there were only 40 participants, I found myself wrestling with nerves. The morning session was dedicated to discussing the role of data in community development and the importance of fostering data literacy at a grassroots level. We were joined by a regional journalist from Thai PBS, representatives from the Chana-Rak-Thin community, a researcher specializing in Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), and one of our team members, a community architect with invaluable field experience. Our diverse group of speakers illustrated the power of data and its implications for the preservation of natural resources and community self-sustainability.

The discussion flowed smoothly with active participation from our attendees, sparking meaningful dialogue, and shedding light on the challenges they were facing. For a first-time moderator, I walked away with invaluable insights from the power of active listening and effective communication.

In the afternoon, I transitioned into the role of an instructor, teaching the participants how to use Notion, a free data management tool, to develop customized databases for their communities. However, teaching was not without its challenges. Taking care of a diverse age group ranging from 18 to 55 required careful adjustment of pace and meticulous observation to ensure everyone was included and engaged. That’s why I had to draw on all my past teaching experience to motivate the participants and get the class moving.

The final session of the workshop, in which the participants were tasked to apply their newly acquired tools to address ongoing problems in their communities, was perhaps my favorite. It provided me the opportunity to evaluate the progress of the participants. It was inspiring to see each group diligently working on their projects, with me and my team moving from one to another offering advice and guidance.

There was one participant who left a lasting impression on me. A resilient woman from the Troping community in Pattani, she swiftly mastered the tools, despite her physical disability. Her enthusiasm was contagious. Not only did she grasp the technical aspects quickly, but she also employed creative, out-of-the-box thinking, leading her team in completing their final task. What moved me further was her determination to continue learning and apply these skills for her community’s benefit. Days after the workshop, she reached out with her work, seeking feedback. Her spirit embodied the change we aimed to facilitate and was a testament to the impact and importance of our work.

Looking back, there were moments of struggle and lessons learned, but the experience has been overwhelmingly positive. Seeing the participants’ determination to use the tools we taught them to better their communities was incredibly rewarding. I firmly believe that equipping people with knowledge and skills is the key to sustainable community development. Also, It’s in these moments, seeing real impact and change, that I’m reminded of the critical role of education in shaping a sustainable future.
