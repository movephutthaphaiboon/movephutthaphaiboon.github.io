“To tackle a very big problem, like climate change, we need to understand things systematically and fundamentally.” It just came into my mind after thinking about this huge problem.

Today I’ve collected a dot as to ecology and learnt how it connects to other areas. My first expectation of learning ecology was that I wanted to understand the climate change problem through the lens of ecologists. I hoped to get into the roots of environmental issues and to acquire new knowledge that helps me pave the way for my master’s degree dissertation.

You know what? I think I got much more than I expected. Despite the very well constructed content, I got inspiration from the course instructors, especially Dr Corina Tarnita from Princeton University, who uses mathematical modeling to explain natural phenomena, such as population growth and patterns of trees growing in the forest. It’s fantastic to see the role of interdisciplinary and of course mathematics everywhere.

This course, [Ecology: Ecosystem Dynamics and Conservation](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ecology-conservation), gave me a whole picture of the ecosystem in multiple perspectives, including biology, economy, and society. I learnt how to think systematically not only about the tip of the iceberg. I really enjoyed the course and learnt a lot!

However, there are many steps to go and to learn.

Thank you Coursera, American Museum of Natural History, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute for providing such a great MOOC for everyone.
