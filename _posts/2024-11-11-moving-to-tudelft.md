The time has finally come! Iâ€™ve arrived at TU Delft as a masterâ€™s student in the [Engineering and Policy Analysis](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/masters/epa/msc-engineering-and-policy-analysis) program! Delft and TU welcomed me with open arms, especially during the Introduction Program, where I met incredible new friends. Itâ€™s inspiring to be surrounded by people who share the same drive for self-improvement and the belief that we can create meaningful change through engineering, science, and interdisciplinary approaches.

Here are some pictures from the IP programâ€”Iâ€™m already loving this journey! I canâ€™t wait to learn, grow, and contribute. Iâ€™ll be sharing more about my experiences at EPA once things settle down. Stay tuned! ðŸ˜Š
