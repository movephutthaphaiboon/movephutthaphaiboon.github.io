Personally, I didn’t really like matcha because (1) matcha drinks i could buy from stores or pop up bars were always too sweet and (2) I didn’t think matcha contained enough caffeine for my day. However, after drinking coffee as a morning beverage for one and a half years, I realized that coffee could keep me awake for 3-5 hours; I felt tired and drowsy later on; I needed another cup of coffee eventually.

I’ve just watched a new Netflix documentary, Breaking Boundaries: The Science of Our Planet. This film is an insightful summary which answers what I have been curious about. It however made me realize my journey in the past year learning CLIMATE CHANGE.

I tried to find ways to tackle climate change as an individual. I read books, watched science documentaries, and listened to climate conversations. The more I research, the more I know that an individual power is very little, whereas the real shift must be made collectively.

It has taken me many years to connect the dots as to climate change and other relevant issues, so I know how difficult it is to make a person feel responsible for environmental problems. Hence, it isn’t surprising that there are so many people who still don’t care or don’t start contributing anything to save our planet.

However, I’m not going to tell you that the climate problems are hard and it’s okay if you don’t pay attention to them because your normal lifestyle without considering the impact on our earth is no longer an option. All aftereffects from our harmful activities on earth are clearly depicted in the Breaking Boundaries film. This wake up call is telling us that we’re going beyond the planetary boundaries which will result in collapsed civilization, frequent droughts and floods, food shortages, no clean air to breathe, and even no home to live in.

Do you think we can live in such a broken world?

I don’t think so and I’d like to encourage all my friends to start thinking about our planet and our future. You can begin your planetary steward journey by watching this film and internalizing the fact, so you’ll get some ideas about why we are at risk. I also want you to try to be open and to adopt new ways of living that help us save lives and humanity. We still have a chance.
