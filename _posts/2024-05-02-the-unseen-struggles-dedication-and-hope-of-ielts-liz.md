Have you ever heard of or used IELTS Liz ?

This post is about Liz, the owner of IELTS Liz. It’s an #IELTS guide platform that has helped me develop my academic English skills. Even though I learned English through many platforms and teachers, her website was actually helpful, especially for writing—the skill I spent most of my time improving. I read almost every tip, trick, and free example given on her site.

I have just watched Liz’s latest video titled "IELTS Liz - My Personal Story". She’s been missing online for 9 years, with no new IELTS teaching videos. In the video, she talked about the hard time she had with uncommon symptoms that made her unable to move or speak. That’s why she was missing. Now she’s getting better, so she can communicate with us again.

Although I didn’t know her personally, I was pretty shocked, to be honest. Liz is one of the people I admire who wholeheartedly contributed to global education. I can say I am one of those who benefited from her hard work. She shared her knowledge for free even when she was consumed by uncommon diseases and suffering.

I think what she has done is not only due to her passion for languages but also for the fact that so many people will benefit from it. Achieving desired scores in IELTS opens many doors for many people.

Sometimes we just need these kinds of people who passionately do something they’re good at to contribute to the community. Look at what you have, what you’re good at, and channel it to create a positive impact on this world. This message is for those of you who have #privilege in this society.
