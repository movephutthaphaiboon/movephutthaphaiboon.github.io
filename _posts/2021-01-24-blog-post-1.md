### I stopped drinking coffee
I stopped drinking coffee and have been drinking matcha for a week. Personally, I didnâ€™t really like matcha because (1) matcha drinks i could buy from stores or pop up bars were always too sweet and (2) I didnâ€™t think matcha contained enough caffeine for my day.

However, after drinking coffee as a morning beverage for one and a half years, I realized that coffee could keep me awake for 3-5 hours; I felt tired and drowsy later on; I needed another cup of coffee eventually. Additionally, I sometimes felt a bit of jitters and dehydrated.

### Some casual research
I did research on the effects of coffee on our health and found that a caffeine spike from coffee consumption is a drawback. Coffee can keep us awake and increase our energy due to its high caffeine content, which is a temporary effect. When it starts to wear off, weâ€™ll feel more tired than before.

During research (Do I look so serious? Maybe.) I found many people use MATCHA for coffee replacement. Although matcha contains about 50% less caffeine than coffee, there is an amino acid called L-Theanine, which slows the release of caffeine and has a relaxing effect. That means matcha allows us to benefit the caffeineâ€™s awakening effect for much longer compared to the huge caffeine spike we get from drinking coffee. Okay, I decided to try this approach, replacing coffee with matcha.

### Result after 1 week
Honestly, I was quite surprised by the result. Drinking matcha makes me feel more relaxed. I like its flavor as itâ€™s grassy and earthy. I donâ€™t feel tired or dehydrated during the day, but I still feel a bit sleepy. I probably get longer and better sleep (I donâ€™t know how to measure it scientifically) and I donâ€™t crave any coffee anymore. Moreover, since Iâ€™ve been preparing matcha myself for a week, itâ€™s like meditating in the morning which is improving my focus and concentration. Itâ€™s art and creative somehow.

Just wanna share and update some little things I got from COVID-19 lockdown. ðŸ˜€
