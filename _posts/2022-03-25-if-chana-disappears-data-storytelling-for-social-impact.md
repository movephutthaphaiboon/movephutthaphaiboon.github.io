After a prolonged period of lockdown and remote working, I eagerly sought opportunities for networking and skill enhancement. My search led me to a workshop perfectly aligned with my interests: leveraging technology to foster a better society.

About a month ago, alongside a friend who is a community architect, I participated in the Data Communication Lab. This data-driven storytelling workshop, facilitated by Punch Up, spanned five weekends from February 26th to March 19th, 2022. The workshop’s curriculum included:
 * Week 1: The role of data communication in societal change
 * Week 2: Techniques in data acquisition and analysis
 * Week 3: Transforming data into civic technology through storytelling and data visualization
 * Week 4: Crafting dara narratives and storyboards
 * Week 5: Pitching day

Our project, a web-based scrollytelling titled ‘[If Chana Disappears](https://ifchanadisappears.my.canva.site/)’, was among 24 team submissions. We aimed to highlight the risk facing the Chana district in southern Thailand, threatened by industrial expansion. Using data on local fish and sea life populations, and survey results on the popularity of seafood products, we illustrated the rich marine biodiversity of Chana’s seas and their crucial role in sustaining local life. Our narrative began with the story of shrimp paste, a staple in Thai cuisine, derived from krill found in pristine waters. We posited that industrial pollution in Chana could decimate the krill population, leading to the disappearance of this beloved condiment. The story concluded with local efforts to resist industrialization and a call to action for readers to support the community through various means.

Our aim was to raise awareness about natural resource conservation, advocate for equitable policies and governance, and encourage transparency in Thailand. We were honored to receive an Honorable Mention for our work, which was a testament to its potential to empower local communities. The experience was enriching, connecting me with like-minded individuals passionate about societal improvement. I invite you to listen to our presentation and explore other captivating stories from the workshop via [Punch Up FB Live](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=443286247463951).
