On Sunday, October 8th, 2023, I had an honor of being part of something truly special. Together with my incredible team at Around the Room Studio and the chief of the Natural History Museum and Local Learning Network, we hosted an event— “Community Database: The Power of Driving Participatory Society”. While the event took place on-site, we ensured inclusivity and extended our reach by providing a live stream on Facebook for our global audience, allowing online audiences to be part of this pivotal gathering.

As a moderator of the event, I witnessed the fruition of a journey that started with our workshop series titled “Participatory Mapping & Community Database Design”, a journey that involved 11 communities in southern Thailand and seamlessly blended three generations of workshop participants across training sessions held on July 15th, August 20th, and September 29th-30th.

## Diverse Databases, Unified Purpose

The databases, although diverse, were united in purpose—to empower each community by harnessing the power of data. The 11 databases presented in the first session of the event were as varied as the communities themselves, from providing in-depth information on the environmental and societal impacts of megaprojects to preserving vital community-related data, falling into four distinct categories:

  1. Databases of Investigative Studies into Governmental Megaprojects
      * Thepha Coal-Fired Power Plant Project
      * Pak Bara Deep Seaport Project
      * Chumphon-Ranong Land Bridge Project

  2. Databases of Pattani Local Intellect
      * Pattani Salt Farming
      * Rice Farming Field Restoration

  3. Databases of Environmental Conservation Networks
      * PSU Pattani’s Natural Resource Conservation Club
      * The Patani Resource
      * Green South Foundation

  4. Databases of Local Communities
      * Troping Village
      * Nam Bo Village
      * Chana District

## Inspiring Presentations & Forward-looking Discussions

11 Communities, each allotted a 5-minute slot, articulated their community narratives and database utility with heartfelt sincerity and commendable preparation, reflecting their empowered selves.

In addition to the community database presentations, the event was further enriched by the insight of six esteemed guests—spanning a politician, an artist, a media expert, scientists, and community leaders renowned for leveraging data against injustice. Their inspirational dialogue offered our 11 teams a lens into the myriad possibilities of using their data to benefit their communities.

## A Tangible Showcase

Beyond the presentations and insightful discussions, we wanted attendees to immerse themselves further into the essence of each community. To achieve this, a mini exhibition was curated, allowing each team to profoundly showcase local products or notable achievements. The display was tactile, interactive, and deeply personal. For instance, the group that delved into sea salt farming didn’t just narrate their findings – they let the visitors taste it. With four distinct types of salt on display, attendees could savor the nuanced differences, providing  flavor-filled insight into the meticulousness of salt farming. Such tangible experiences enhanced the event, offering a deeper, sensory connection to each community’s pride and efforts.

## Reflections and Forward Momentum

As an event organizer and community database instructor in these 2-3 months, I could see the improvement in terms of skills and data literacy of my students. Many of them started thinking of ways to further develop their databases by collaborating with other communities. Moreover, listening to stories from locals about their past based on real data made me understand the connections between their way of life, natural resources they’ve been protected, and potential of the area that can create many new possibilities. It was the power of data to reveal facts and strengthen these communities from inside. In other words, the power of data is to drive just society and allow people to define the future of their communities.

Last but not least, I am so proud of myself and my team hosting this event. All databases presented that day were made with the motivation of the locals and our dedication to design all the class’s materials and teaching. Before all this happened, I thought it’d be good if I could teach 2-3 communities to equip them with database tools and data literacy. However, right now, my team and I could create a community database learning network that connects more than 10 local communities in southern Thailand. This makes me want to improve my teaching. I wish I could have more time to advise them. And more importantly, I hope people in power see the impact of data literacy at the grassroot level and support us, allowing us to create more classes that give people new skills and knowledge.

Lastly, I just want to say that, during my 1-year journey working with communities, I could realize the potential of people there. I believe they can improve. I’m so glad I had chances to share what I’ve learned with people of all ages. They’re the driver of today’s society. Thank you everyone for letting me be part of your learning and growing. I’ve learned a lot as well.
