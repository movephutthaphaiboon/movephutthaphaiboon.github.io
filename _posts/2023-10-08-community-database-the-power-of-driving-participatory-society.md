On Sunday, October 8th, 2023, I had an honor of being part of something truly special. Together with my incredible team at Around the Room Studio and the chief of the Natural History Museum and Local Learning Network, we hosted an event— “Community Database: The Power of Driving Participatory Society”. While the event took place on-site, we ensured inclusivity and extended our reach by providing a live stream on Facebook for our global audience, allowing online audiences to be part of this pivotal gathering.

As a moderator of the event, I witnessed the fruition of a journey that started with our workshop series titled “Participatory Mapping & Community Database Design”, a journey that involved 11 communities in southern Thailand and seamlessly blended three generations of workshop participants across training sessions held on July 15th, August 20th, and September 29th-30th.

## Diverse Databases, Unified Purpose

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>11 community databases from our trained participants | Explore the databases via [this link](https://openlink.co/aroundtheroomstudio)</em></p>

The databases, although diverse, were united in purpose—to empower each community by harnessing the power of data. The 11 databases presented in the first session of the event were as varied as the communities themselves, from providing in-depth information on the environmental and societal impacts of megaprojects to preserving vital community-related data, falling into four distinct categories:

  1. Databases of Investigative Studies into Governmental Megaprojects
      * Thepha Coal-Fired Power Plant Project
      * Pak Bara Deep Seaport Project
      * Chumphon-Ranong Land Bridge Project

  2. Databases of Pattani Local Intellect
      * Pattani Salt Farming
      * Rice Farming Field Restoration

  3. Databases of Environmental Conservation Networks
      * PSU Pattani’s Natural Resource Conservation Club
      * The Patani Resource
      * Green South Foundation

  4. Databases of Local Communities
      * Troping Village
      * Nam Bo Village
      * Chana District
