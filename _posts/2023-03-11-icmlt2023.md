Excited to share that I recently presented my research on 'Forecasting Arctice Sea Ice Concentration Using Long Short-term Memory Networks' at [2023 8th International Conference on Machine Learning Technologies (ICMLT 2023)](http://www.icmlt.org/2023.html) in Stockholm, Sweden. I'm proud to have contributed to a better understanding of Arctic sea ice and its role in climate change, and to be part of a community of researchers working to address the most pressing challenges of our time. Can't wait to see new insights and breakthroughs emerging from this vibrant and innovative field!

My research titled <em>Forecasting Arctic Sea Ice Concentration using Long Short-term Memory Networks</em> has been published online in ACM Library Digital [here](https://doi.org/10.1145/3589883.3589901).
